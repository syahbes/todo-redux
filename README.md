# To-do list with Redux and Firebase

This project is a to-do list that demonstrates the use of Redux and Firebase in combination. The goal of the project was to practice using these technologies together to manage state and user identity. The project utilizes Redux for state management, Firebase for user identity management and storing information specific to individual users, and AsyncThunk to connect the two. In addition, the project includes the implementation of dotenv for hiding keys and the use of Material UI for styling, including a dark/light mode switch.
